                        <h1>Keep Calm and Strive</h1>
                        <p>Given the multiplication in rewards for good deeds during Ramadan, particularly under the condition of fasting, many of us approach the month with enthusiasm and resolutions. Unfortunately we forget the planning part which often leads to missed opportunities following energy spikes, dehydration and sleep deprivation. Speaking from experience, promising yourself that you’ll cut out a lifelong bad habit overnight is a fantasy and setting unachievable goals without the preparation will leave you feeling deflated and sometimes even anxious. The 8th month in the Islamic calendar, Sha’ban, is considered the month of preparation, following the Sunnah (practise of the Prophet Muhammed, peace be upon Him) and is a good time to work on your Ramadan goals.</p>

                    <h2>Setting Goals: Ambition vs Consistency</h2>
                    <p>Be ambitious and set yourself goals. Focus on your own journey and don’t be dissuaded by general checklists that often circulate on social media. Despite the coming together at Iftar (breaking the fast at sunset), Ramadan is a time of reflection and working on oneself. From reading supplications to waking up for night prayers, make strides in your own personal achievements.</p>
                    <h3>Completing the Qur’an</h3>
                    <p>Reciting and understanding the Qur’an should be at the top of any list of Ramadan goals. However, it is important to be realistic about your capabilities and available time. There are well known guidelines on how to break down the 30 chapters of the Qur’an by completing 1 a day, spread across 5 prayers per day, although I would still suggest contingency planning for those of you who do shift work like I do. Ramadan also brings the congregational night prayers, Tewawih, which consists of several Imaams reciting 20 verses of the Qur’an completing 1 chapter per night so this is also a good opportunity to participate in.</p>
                    <h3>Quitting a Bad Habit</h3>
                    <p>The key to not overwhelming yourself and achieving your goals is structure, progressive milestones and conditioning. Remember, you’ll also be sleep deprived so don’t shock your system by quitting cold turkey all of a sudden. Reward yourself for hard work but just keep it halal and try and avoid impulsive urges. Just a last point on this one, and I need to take heed of this advice myself, hold your tongue! We’re all fighting our struggles.</p>
