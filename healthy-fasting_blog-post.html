                        <p>Fasting is a means to achieve mindfulness and God-consciousness, known as “taqwa” in Arabic. The conditions upon a fasting person, with sincere intention, naturally heighten self-awareness and God-consciousness in all aspects throughout the day, from dietary choices that boost productivity to appreciation and contentment. It is a Sunnah, (a practice of the Prophet Muhammad - Peace be upon Him) to observe intermittent fasting throughout the year and there are several benefits of doing so - both physiological and psychological. We’ve all heard of a detox, whether that’s away from screen time or fatty foods, structure and discipline are key to achieving well-rounded good health (note to self). Let’s have a look at how intermittent fasting can be a holistic approach to a better you.</p>
                    </header>
                    <h2>Detox</h2>
                    <p>Our bodies naturally go through a detox whilst fasting so it’s important to maintain this through our two main meal choices. Practicing self-restraint throughout the year for a nutritious, protein-packed, slow energy releasing meal at the beginning of the fast followed by a replenishing and well-balanced meal for breaking the fast will keep you in the green. Keeping this going, intermittently, will help reinforce long term changes and increase self-reflection.</p>
                    <h3>Foods to Avoid</h3>
                    <p>It is common knowledge that a well-balanced diet should be central to any dietary plan. This was not so common in my household, as Bangladeshi dishes are mostly rice-based and fried snacks are very popular during gatherings and special occasions. It can be difficult to break away from unhealthy traditions and get the support of the rest of the family, especially when all you want is some comfort food so be ready for the backlash. Treats in moderation are a good incentive and will hopefully make is easier to get the support of the household.</p>
                    <p>A few of the harms that should be avoided include refined carbs, processed foods, artificial food coloring, and preservatives, all of which have been found to be inflammatory and linked to diseases such as diabetes, cancer, mental illnesses like anxiety, depression, ADD.</p>

                    <h3>Foods to be Encouraged</h3>
                    <p>As a Muslim, it’s important to value lessons and advice we can take from the Sunnah, as well as scientific research. Here's a list of nutritious foods to include in your Suhur (pre-fast) and Iftar (post fast) meals:</p>

                <p>Salaam / Hi, my name is Abubakar Siddique and I'm an aspiring Front End Web Developer. I've always wanted to create my own blog and here's my first attempt at one. Islam is something I care very much about so it made sense to explore the topic of Ramadan and hopefully contribute towards something that others, myself included, will benefit from. A key driver for me has been the opportunity to first hand, share what Ramadan is about to viewers of all backgrounds by carefully trying to find a balance between rich content and simplified explanations.</p>
                <p>Throughout my own spiritual journey, I've come across some fantastic resources that are easily accessible in today's online world such as academic papers by established sholars at Yaqeen Institute, infographics and publications by charities that are dear to me, such as Muslimn Hands. To get in touch, grab my social media handler from above and let me know what you think of what you find here. Peace!</p>
