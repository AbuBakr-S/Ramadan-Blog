                <p>The 9th month in the Islamic Calendar, Ramadan is the most valuable time of the year to Muslims. Widely known as the month of fasting, it is a time of true personal sacrifice, discipline and endless opportunity for the prepared and ambitious. Good deeds are multiplied during the month and many flock to the Mosques in the evenings for the additional night prayers called Terawih where the Imaams lead prayers reciting all the verses of the Qur'an throughout the month.</p>

                        <h3>Keep Calm and Strive</h3>
                        <p>Given the multiplication in rewards for good deeds during Ramadan, particularly under the condition of fasting, many of us approach the month with enthusiasm and resolutions. Unfortunately we forget the planning part which often leads to missed opportunities following energy spikes, dehydration and sleep deprivation. Speaking from experience, promising yourself that you’ll cut out a lifelong bad habit overnight is a fantasy and setting unachievable goals without the preparation will leave you feeling deflated and sometimes even anxious. The 8th month in the Islamic calendar, Sha’ban, is considered the month of preparation, following the Sunnah (practise of the Prophet Muhammed, peace be upon Him) and is a good time to work on your Ramadan goals.</p>

                        <h3>Appreciation</h3>
                        <p>The effects of fasting are not limited to physiology. In fact, a person who simply fasts through Ramadan, solely giving up food and drink, is considered to be at great loss. A fasting person should have a natural disposition to the poor and hungry while truly appreciating the blessings they enjoy everyday. Islam softens the hearts and encourages humility, building supportive communities and the distrubution of wealth through laws and responsibilities, individual and shared, embodied by the life of the Prophet Muhammed (peace be upon Him).</p>

                        <h3>Healthy Fasting</h3>
                        <p>Fasting is a means to achieve mindfulness and God-consciousness, known as “taqwa” in Arabic. The conditions upon a fasting person, with sincere intention, naturally heighten self-awareness and God-consciousness in all aspects throughout the day, from dietary choices that boost productivity to appreciation and contentment. It is a Sunnah, (a practice of the Prophet Muhammad - Peace be upon Him) to observe intermittent fasting throughout the year and there are several benefits of doing so - both physiological and psychological. We’ve all heard of a detox, whether that’s away from screen time or fatty foods, structure and discipline are key to achieving well-rounded good health (note to self). Let’s have a look at how intermittent fasting can be a holistic approach to a better you.</p>
